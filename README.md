<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Here's my solution for the challenge!

- You can find my demo [here](https://input-component-devchallenges.vercel.app/)
- In the end it was more challenging than I thought at first, I decided to got for a more component based approach for the inputs and I was very satisfied with my result.
- I've definitely improved my thought process on how to approach the build of component.
- So as I pray, unlimited bug works.

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/TSqutYM4c5WtluM7QzGp) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

In this challenge I again opted to make the icons conditional on the string input the user passes, so that you can choose the icon you want from [GoogleIcons](https://fonts.google.com/icons), when you decide on the icon you want you just need to input what comes in the span tag as the following example:

There is also the Storybook documentation that you can run on your computer, but I couldn't find a way to replicate the icons into the Storybook, but all the other features are available.
